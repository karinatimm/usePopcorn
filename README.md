# usePopcorn App

### Project Description

usePopcorn is a movie application that allows users to search for movies, view details, rate them, and manage a watchlist. The app utilizes React hooks extensively, showcasing functionalities such as state management, side effects, custom hooks, and more. This project demonstrates the integration of real data fetching from an API, component reusability, and a focus on hooks to manage various aspects of the application state. So one can add movies to the watched list and rate one's favorite movies to keep track of them. Enjoy!

This project was completed by me as part of the course "The Ultimate React Course 2024: React, Redux & More" created by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://twitter.com/jonasschmedtman) on the Udemy educational platform.
